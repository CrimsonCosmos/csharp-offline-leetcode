You are given two positive integers n and limit.
Return the total number of ways to distribute n candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than limit candies.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, limit = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 ways to distribute 5 candies such that no child gets more than 2 candies: (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2) and (2, 2, 1).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, limit = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 ways to distribute 3 candies such that no child gets more than 3 candies: (0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 0), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (3, 0, 0).
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 106
- 1 <= limit <= 106

1. We can enumerate the number of candies of one particular child, let it be <code>i</code> which means <code>0 <= i <= min(limit, n)</code>.
2. Suppose the 2nd child gets <code>j</code> candies. Then <code>0 <= j <= limit</code> and <code>i + j <= n</code>.
3. The 3rd child will hence get <code>n - i - j</code> candies and we should have <code>0 <= n - i - j <= limit</code>.
4. After some transformations, for each <code>i</code>, we have <code>max(0, n - i - limit) <= j <= min(limit, n - i)</code>, each <code>j</code> corresponding to a solution.
So the number of solutions for some <code>i</code> is <code>max(min(limit, n - i) - max(0, n - i - limit) + 1, 0)</code>. Sum the expression for every <code>i</code> in <code>[0, min(n, limit)]</code>.
