# 2785. Sort Vowels in a String
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** String, Sorting
**Link (online only):** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-vowels-in-a-string/

Given a 0-indexed string s, permute s to get a new string t such that:
Return the resulting string.
The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "lEetcOde"
Output: "lEOtcede"
Explanation: 'E', 'O', and 'e' are the vowels in s; 'l', 't', 'c', and 'd' are all consonants. The vowels are sorted according to their ASCII values, and the consonants remain in the same places.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "lYmpH"
Output: "lYmpH"
Explanation: There are no vowels in s (all characters in s are consonants), so we return "lYmpH".
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists only of letters of the English alphabet in uppercase and lowercase.

1. Add all the vowels in an array and sort the array.
2. Replace characters in string s if it's a vowel from the new array.
