In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

**Constraints:**
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 15
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
- There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
