You are given an array nums consisting of n prime integers.
You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].
Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.
If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]
Output: [-1,1,4,3]
Explanation:
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [11,13,31]
Output: [9,12,15]
Explanation:
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 2 <= nums[i] <= 109
- nums[i] is a prime number.

1. Consider the binary representation of <code>nums[i]</code>.
2. Answer is -1 for even <code>nums[i]</code>.
3. Try unsetting a single bit from <code>nums[i]</code>.
